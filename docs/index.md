# Spark

## About
It looks like Per Wendel is no longer continuing this wonderful [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com)-like micro web framework for Java. This is the community driven continuation. More supporters are welcome!
If you want to change something, submit a pull request. If you found a bug, submit a test case - also as a PR.
For questions please use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/sparkjavateam/spark/discussions). Also see the [Javadoc](http://javadoc.io/doc/io.github.sparkjavateam/spark-core).
This framework is also called Sparkjava to avoid confusion with Apache Spark.
Main support is for **Java 17**. It also works and is tested for Java 11 LTS and Java 21 LTS. It might work for other versions >= 8.
